One of the strengths of Next.js that sets it apart from other frameworks, such as Create React App and Gatsby.js, is its file-system based routing.

## Next.js Routing: An Introduction

Next.js optimizes routing by tying routes to file names in the 'pages' directory. Each file in the 'pages' directory corresponds to a route based on its file name.

```js
function About() {
  return (
    <h1>About Us</h1>
  )
}

export default About
```

The above code, when placed in a file named about.js inside the pages directory, becomes accessible at the /about route.

### Dynamic Routes in Next.js
Next.js also supports dynamic routes, allowing you to capture parts of the URL as parameters for your pages.

```js
function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  return (
    <h1>Welcome, user {userId}</h1>
  )
}

UserProfile.getInitialProps = async ({ query }) => {
  return { userId: query.id }
}

export default UserProfile
```

Here, if the file resides in `pages/user/[id].js`, you can access `http://localhost:3000/user/123`, and the page displays "Welcome, user 123". The router populates the `[id]` in the page's path with the appropriate parameter from the URL.

### Conclusion
The simplicity and intuitiveness of Next.js' file-system based routing makes developing React applications significantly smoother. It eliminates much of the manual configuration other routers, such as react-router, require, allowing you to focus on building great user experiences.
